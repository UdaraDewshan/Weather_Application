# Weather Application

## Project Overview
The Weather Application is a real-time app that allows users to check the current weather and forecasts for any city worldwide. It fetches data from a reliable weather API and provides detailed information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather conditions. The app features an intuitive and responsive interface, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. It also supports location-based weather detection for convenience.

## Features
- Search weather by city name
- Real-time weather updates
- Location-based weather detection
- Detailed weather information: temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs or API failures

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- External Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- Optional: frameworks like React or Vue (if applicable)

## What I Learned
- Consuming and integrating external APIs to fetch real-time data
- Parsing JSON responses and dynamically updating the UI
- Implementing responsive design for different screen sizes
- Handling errors and edge cases gracefully
- Structuring a small project efficiently

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **API Integration:** Initially struggled with fetching and parsing API data. Solved by reading documentation and testing requests using Postman.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Adapting the layout for mobile and desktop. Solved with CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.
- **Error Handling:** Ensuring invalid inputs don’t break the app. Solved with proper exception handling and user notifications.
